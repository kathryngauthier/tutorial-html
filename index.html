    <p>George Lucas thought the scene between <strong>Han Solo </strong>and Gredo in the cantina made Han cold cold blodded. Let's think about the original scene shall we. Gredo the bounty Hunter is hoding Han at gun point and says in his gurgly voice he is going to kill him and shoots him though the table before Gredo can blow Han a new smuggling hatch. That makes Han <em>cool</em>, not cold.</p>
